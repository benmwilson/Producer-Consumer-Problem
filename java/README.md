# Producer-Consumer-Problem Java Implementation

## How to Compile

Navigate to `/java/src/` and open a new terminal. Inside this terminal, type `javac Main.java` to compile the main execution file. 

All the files should come pre-compiled. If you come across errors, try compiling `Consumer.java`, `Monitor.java`, and `Producer.java` again the same as you did for `Main.java`.

## How to Run the Code

Navigate to `/java/src/` and open a new terminal. Inside this terminal, type `java Main` followed by two integers seperated by spaces, for example : `java Main 8 8`. These integers are the arguments required to run the code.  

The first argument is the desired number of consumers and the second argument is the max duration of a request.
