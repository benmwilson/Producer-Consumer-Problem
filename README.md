  The Producer-Consumer Problem

</p>

<p align="center">
In computing, the producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue. This repo houses two implementations of this problem coded in Java and C/C++.

#### Project Outline

The goal of this project is to use threads and synchronization to implement an
useful application based on the Producer Consumer problem, also known as the bounded-buffer problem.
This project has two parts, one completed in Java and another in C/C++
with the overall goal of demonstrating threading and synchronization
concepts in two widely used programming languages.
